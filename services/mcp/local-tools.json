Use this when the user's request needs a comprehensive plan outlined BEFORE execution. This will generate a workflow using the available tools and return the plan without executing anything. Choose this INSTEAD OF executing regular tools when: (1) The user explicitly asks for a 'plan', 'workflow', or 'steps', or (2) The task is complex enough that showing a coordinated approach first provides value. The workflow will be composed from the other available MCP tools. After calling this, the conversation will end with the workflow plan as the response.",
